# Gini Impurity Calculation

This project is a simple implementation to calculate the Gini Impurity for features in a dataset. It is part of a practice project
assigned by a university professor, designed to help students learn basic data analysis concepts.

## How It Works
- The script processes an Excel file containing a dataset.
- It calculates the Gini Impurity for each feature in the dataset.
- The smaller the Gini Impurity, the greater the feature's impact.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`

## Usage
1. Make sure the dataset is in an Excel file.
2. Place the file path in the `file_path` variable inside the script.
3. Run the script to see the Gini Impurity results.

### Notes
- The last column of the dataset must contain the target labels (`yes` or `no`).
- All features should be in numeric or categorical format.

## Documentation
All details, including the explanation of the code and its output, are available in the `gini-impurity.pdf` file provided with this project.

## Disclaimer
This is a simple exercise and not intended for production use. The goal is to understand the concept of Gini Impurity in a straightforward way.
